## The Problem (30 seconds)

Retail stores face a critical challenge: **matching staff levels to customer traffic**.

- **Understaffing** during peak hours = lost sales, poor customer experience
- **Overstaffing** during slow periods = wasted labor costs
- **Current systems** use flat, one-size-fits-all schedules that don't adapt to actual traffic patterns

**The result?** We're leaving money on the table every single day.

## Our Solution (1 minute)

The **Pandora AI Traffic & Staffing Optimizer** is an AI-powered dashboard that predicts customer traffic and recommends optimal staffing levels in real-time.

### How It Works:
1. **Predicts traffic** hour-by-hour and day-by-day using AI forecasting
2. **Recommends staffing** based on predicted customer visits (1 FTE per 50 visits)
3. **Tracks implementation** - managers commit to either AI or legacy staffing daily
4. **Measures results** - compares forecasted vs. realized staffing efficiency

### Key Innovation:
We don't just provide recommendations - we **track whether managers trust and implement them**, creating accountability and measuring real adoption.
